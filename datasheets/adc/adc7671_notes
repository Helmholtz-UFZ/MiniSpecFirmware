ADC 7671
---------

Added restistor R27:
 used to have only one powersupply (see pg.4, section "SUPPLYING POWER FOR STAND-ALONE USE" in EVAL-AD76XXEDZ.pdf)

Removed Inputbuffer by disabling JP1 and JP2. Now signal is inputed directly in the SIG+/SIG- terminals.
 
Solder-pads (see back of the PCB):
 We use 0-5V input range. So we set these pads:
  s3
  s4
  s6 
 info:
  s9 open
  s10 closed
  
 This means (see Table I. in AD7671.pdf):
  INA: INGND
  INB: V_in
  INC: V_in
  IND: V_in
